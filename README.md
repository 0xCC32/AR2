## 6 axis stepper motor robot and control software

This project includes:

- Bill of materials and instructions
- CAD files to 3D print components to build the robot
- Arduino sketch for stepper driver control
- Software to program and operate robot
- Kinematic model

All geared stepper motors and drivers are available from  [www.omc-stepperonline.com](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/?tracking=59c1139e8987b) and all other misc. hardware are off-the-shelf items available from multiple sources (see the bill of materials info within each manual).
