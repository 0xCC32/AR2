## Download Raspbian OS

If you are using a "fresh" Raspberry Pi, you'll need to get an OS on a Micro SD card to use the RPI.  Go to Raspberry Pi's [download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) page to get the latest Raspbian distribution for Raspberry Pi.  At the time of this writing, the OS is "Raspbian Stretch with desktop and recommended software".  This page also has instructions for writing the OS image to a Micro SD card as well.
