# Set up Access Point

[Return to README.md](../README.md)

Follow the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md) on setting up a wireless access point.  **This only works if you have wireless capability on your Raspberry Pi.** 

Wireless functionality is currently available on the following devices:
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Raspberry Pi 3

Additional RPi devices may support this method, but the aforementioned devices have been tested and are confirmed to work.
